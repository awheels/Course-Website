		This site is a collection of the resources and lessons that I use in my mathematics courses. I strongly believe in the power of sharing, reusing and adapting resources to enhance teaching and learning. I also believe in giving credit where credit is due and for that reason I've tried to acknowledge any educators or sites that have used and/or adapted resources from. If you find anything on my site that is being used without permission please contact me and I will happily remove it.
