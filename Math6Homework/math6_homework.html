		This page lists the extra practice problems for each of the units in Math 6. Some of the problems come from the Haese & Harris MYP Math 1 and 2 textbooks. The majority come from the <strong>"How Likely Is It?" PDF document</strong> that can be found in Managebac. Your notebook will be checked on a weekly basis to see that you are attempting these problems.

It is important that you understand the difference between experimental and theoretical probability. In these problems you will be able to apply your understanding of experimental probability to a variety of situations. You will then begin to practice an listing possible outcomes of various events, which is a very important skill for working with and understanding theoretical probability. Tree diagrams are also a very useful tool for helping you to simplify and solve probability problems. </td>
